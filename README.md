## Issues

Since the project was dropped midway, there are some known problems you should be aware of:

-  **Performance isn't optimized**: Even with uncapped FPS, performance is significantly lower compared to other clients.
-  **Play Freeze Bug**: There's a known issue where the players freezes during play. It doesn’t crash, but gets stuck for a few seconds.
-  **No further development**: These issues won’t be patched by the original devs unless the project is revived.

If you're planning to fork or use this client, feel free to improve on these — PRs are always welcome if this ever gets active again.
